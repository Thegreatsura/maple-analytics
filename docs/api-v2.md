# Maple v2 Public API

The Maple v2 API is the public, documented, stability-committed HTTP surface for everything the dashboard can do. It follows Stripe's API design philosophy — resource-oriented URLs, prefixed object IDs, uniform list/error envelopes, scoped keys — modernized where Stripe's v1 mechanics are legacy (JSON PATCH updates instead of form-encoded POST, ISO-8601 timestamps instead of epoch seconds).

The **executable contract is the spec**: `MapleApiV2` in `packages/domain/src/http/v2/` (an Effect `HttpApi`). OpenAPI is derived from it automatically and served as an interactive reference at **`/v2/docs`**. This document is the design-guideline layer every v2 contract file must conform to, plus the roadmap for the full surface.

## Architecture: two tiers

| Tier             | Transport                                                       | Consumers                            | Docs                        | Stability                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Public API**   | `MapleApiV2` HttpApi at `/v2/...`                               | Customers, agents/MCP, the dashboard | `/v2/docs` (OpenAPI/Scalar) | Committed; changes are additive or versioned |
| **Internal RPC** | Effect RPC (`effect/unstable/rpc`) `RpcGroup`s served at `/rpc` | The dashboard only                   | none (private)              | None; changes freely                         |

Dashboard-only operations — billing checkout/portal, onboarding state, demo seeding, AI chat apply, digest subscription, AI-triage settings, integration OAuth flows (Slack/Cloudflare/PlanetScale/GitHub), raw warehouse queries, and the error-agent claim/heartbeat/release loop — live in the internal RPC tier. They use the same tenant resolution and org scoping but are **not** HTTP API groups and never appear in the public OpenAPI. Everything else is public API, and the dashboard consumes the same `/v2` endpoints customers do.

The v1 API (`/api/...`) stays mounted while the dashboard migrates group-by-group; each v1 group is deleted once nothing consumes it.

## Conventions

### URLs and methods

Resources are snake_case plural nouns directly under `/v2`:

```
GET    /v2/api_keys              list
POST   /v2/api_keys              create
GET    /v2/api_keys/{id}         retrieve
DELETE /v2/api_keys/{id}         revoke (returns the final object)
POST   /v2/api_keys/{id}/roll    non-CRUD verbs are sub-resource POSTs
POST   /v2/traces/search         complex reads are POST .../search
```

### Object IDs

Every v2 object has a prefixed public ID (`key_4CzLmR…`, `dash_…`, `alrt_…`). Public IDs are opaque; internally they are a reversible base58 encoding of the internal ID, computed at the API boundary (`packages/domain/src/http/v2/public-id.ts` — the prefix registry lives there and is the single source of truth). No database migration: rows keep their raw UUIDs / internal strings.

Prefixes: `key` (API key), `ingk` (ingest key), `dash` (dashboard), `dbv` (dashboard version), `dtpl` (dashboard template), `alrt` (alert rule), `dest` (alert destination), `inc` (alert incident), `einc` (error incident), `iss` (error issue), `inv` (investigation), `anom` (anomaly incident), `scrp` (scrape target), `rec` (recommendation), `amap` (attribute mapping), and `srep` (session replay); `evt` and `we` are reserved for events/webhooks.

Exception: Clerk-issued `org_…` / `user_…` IDs are already prefixed public IDs and pass through unchanged.

A malformed or wrong-prefix ID fails request decoding and returns an `invalid_request_error`.

### Wire format

- **snake_case** JSON field names everywhere (`key_prefix`, `created_at`).
- Every resource carries **`object`** (`"api_key"`, `"dashboard"`, `"list"`, …).
- **Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings** (`2026-07-15T12:34:56.000Z`).
- Nullable fields are explicit `null`, not omitted.

### Lists and pagination

Every list endpoint accepts `limit` (1–100, default 20) and an opaque `cursor`, and responds with the list envelope:

```json
{
	"object": "list",
	"data": [{ "...": "..." }],
	"has_more": true,
	"next_cursor": "off_1k"
}
```

`next_cursor` is `null` on the last page. Cursors are opaque — clients must not parse them. (Endpoints backed by keyset pagination and endpoints backed by materialized arrays use different cursor payloads; the wire contract is identical.)

Offset-backed endpoints fetch `limit + 1` rows from their backing store to determine `has_more`; they do not load a fixed history window and paginate it in memory. Every ordering has a deterministic tie-breaker.

### Errors

Every error response body is exactly:

```json
{
	"error": {
		"type": "not_found_error",
		"code": "api_key_not_found",
		"message": "API key not found",
		"param": "id"
	}
}
```

- `type` is closed: `invalid_request_error` (400), `authentication_error` (401), `permission_error` (403), `not_found_error` (404), `conflict_error` (409), `rate_limit_error` (429), `api_error` (5xx).
- `code` is a stable machine-readable string (`api_key_not_found`, `alert_destination_in_use`, `api_key_lookup_unavailable`, `insufficient_scope`, `parameter_invalid`, …). Resource and dependency failures identify the affected resource and operation. Codes are append-only.
- `param` names the offending parameter when applicable; `doc_url` may link to reference docs.
- No internal tags or stack traces ever appear on the wire.
- Expected internal failures use operation-specific tagged errors. Unexpected defects are logged with the group and operation, then returned as a sanitized `api_error` / `internal_error`; dependency messages are never copied to public 5xx responses.

Implementation: `packages/domain/src/http/v2/errors.ts`; request-decode failures are rewritten into the envelope with a structured `param` by `V2SchemaErrors`, and `V2UnexpectedErrors` provides the defect boundary (`apps/api/src/routes/v2/error-envelope.ts`).

### Authentication and scopes

```
Authorization: Bearer maple_ak_…
```

v2 accepts the same credentials as v1: API keys (`maple_ak_…`) and dashboard session tokens (Clerk or self-hosted JWT). API keys can be **restricted with scopes** at creation:

- Grammar: `<family>:read`, `<family>:write`, or `*`. The family is the first path segment under `/v2` (`api_keys`, `dashboards`, `alerts`, `error_issues`, `traces`, …).
- Enforcement is mechanical: `GET`/`HEAD` and explicitly declared read-only query POSTs (such as session-replay search, trace lookup, and alert preview) require `<family>:read`; mutations require `<family>:write`. `write` implies `read`.
- Keys with no scopes (all pre-v2 keys) have full access. Session tokens are never scope-checked — the dashboard's authorization comes from org roles, like Stripe's own dashboard.
- Failing the check returns `permission_error` / `insufficient_scope`.

Implementation: `packages/domain/src/http/v2/auth.ts` + `apps/api/src/services/ApiAuthorizationV2Layer.ts`; scopes are stored on `api_keys.scopes` (jsonb).

### Versioning

- The `/v2` path prefix is the major version. Breaking changes require `/v3`.
- Within v2, changes are additive (new endpoints, new optional fields, new enum values documented as open sets, new error codes).
- A `Maple-Version: YYYY-MM-DD` header is reserved for future in-v2 evolution; until multiple versions exist, it is accepted and ignored.

### Idempotency (Phase 4 — reserved)

Mutating endpoints will accept an `Idempotency-Key` header. Replays within the retention window return the original response. Backed by a Postgres `idempotency_keys` table keyed by `(org_id, key)`.

### Rate limiting (Phase 4 — reserved)

Per-key rate limits will return `429` with the error envelope (`type: "rate_limit_error"`) and a `Retry-After` header.

### Expansion — not supported

Stripe-style `expand[]` is deliberately omitted: responses embed the small, always-wanted sub-objects directly. May be revisited once real client demand exists.

## Resource catalog (target surface)

Implemented in phases; the pilot (`api_keys`) ships first and proves every convention.

The long tail of ~40 query-engine RPC endpoints (facets, infra hosts/pods/nodes/workloads, Cloudflare/PlanetScale infra) starts in the internal RPC tier and is promoted into `/v2` individually as shapes stabilize.

Not in v2: org membership and invitations (delegated to Clerk; revisit if/when a members API is needed).

### Optional ElectricSQL `txid` metadata

The dashboard can reconcile optimistic writes against ElectricSQL synced shapes using a Postgres `txid` on mutation responses (dashboards, alert rules/destinations, error issues). The field is optional because v2 is a public API: callers neither provide nor require it, and non-ElectricSQL consumers can ignore it. When the persistence path exposes a transaction ID, Maple includes it as opaque reconciliation metadata.

## Rollout phases

- **Phase 0 (this change)** — conventions doc, v2 primitives (`public-id`, `envelopes`, `errors`, `auth`), scoped API keys (schema + service + enforcement), `MapleApiV2` shell mounted at `/v2` with Scalar docs at `/v2/docs`, pilot resource `api_keys` end-to-end with tests.
- **Phase 1 — core resources**: dashboards, alerts, error issues, scrape targets, ingest keys, attribute mappings, investigations, anomalies, recommendations, organization, session replays. Thin handler adapters over existing services; `txid` preserved.
- **Phase 2 — telemetry reads**: traces/logs/metrics/services/service_map/query over `QueryEngineService`.
- **Phase 3 — internal RPC tier + dashboard migration**: `RpcGroup` contracts in `packages/domain/src/rpc/` served at `/rpc`; dashboard gets a `MapleApiV2AtomClient` (same wiring as `apps/web/src/lib/services/common/atom-client.ts`, pointed at `MapleApiV2`) plus an `RpcClient`; migrate group-by-group, deleting v1 groups as they empty. (Note: the billing-scoped 401 retry in `atom-client.ts` must follow billing to its RPC home.)
- **Phase 4 — hardening**: `Idempotency-Key`, per-key rate limiting (Workers rate-limit binding), `Maple-Version` header enforcement.
- **Phase 5 — events & webhooks**: `evt_` event objects, `GET /v2/events`, `/v2/webhook_endpoints` CRUD, HMAC-signed deliveries (`Maple-Signature`) via an outbox drained by the alerting worker.

## Adding a v2 resource (checklist)

1. Contract in `packages/domain/src/http/v2/<resource>.ts`: snake_case wire schemas with an `object` literal and validated `Timestamp` fields; public IDs via `PublicId(prefix, InternalId)` (register the prefix in `public-id.ts`); lists use `ListQuery` + `ListOf`; errors from `v2/errors.ts` only; group `.prefix("/v2/<resource>")` + `.middleware(AuthorizationV2)` + `.middleware(V2SchemaErrors)`.
2. Add the group to `MapleApiV2` in `v2/api.ts` and export from `v2/index.ts`.
3. Handlers in `apps/api/src/routes/v2/<resource>.http.ts`: thin adapters over the existing service — map camelCase/epoch-ms service responses to the wire model, map service tagged errors to envelope errors. Register the layer in `ApiV2Routes` (`apps/api/src/app.ts`).
4. Tests: wire-shape encode (snake_case, public ID, envelope), error mapping, and a PGlite service test if the service changed.
5. Confirm the resource renders correctly at `/v2/docs`.
