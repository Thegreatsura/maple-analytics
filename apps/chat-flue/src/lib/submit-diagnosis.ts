 * investigation row + applies the issue-side severity/timeline effects) and
 * returns a render marker the web turns into the inline report card.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT routed through `applyApprovalGates`: it is the
 * structured-output channel, not a user-facing mutation, so it executes
 * autonomously without an approval card (mirrors the legacy `submit_triage`).
 * The investigation id and org ride server-side from the session instance id —
 * the agent never chooses which investigation it writes.
