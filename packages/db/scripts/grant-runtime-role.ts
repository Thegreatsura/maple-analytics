/**
 * Re-grant table/sequence privileges on a PlanetScale Postgres branch to the
 * RUNTIME app role (the role the deployed worker authenticates as through its
 * Hyperdrive binding) — distinct from the ephemeral `migrate-<branch>-<pid>`
 * role that runs DDL.
 *
 * Why this exists: schema migrations create (and table-rebuild data-migrations
 * DROP+CREATE) tables owned by the migration role / `postgres`. In Postgres,
 * `DROP TABLE` discards all grants and a fresh `CREATE TABLE` only carries owner
 * privileges — so after a rebuild the runtime role hits `permission denied for
 * table …` on every read/write until it is re-granted. Nothing in plain
 * `drizzle-kit migrate` does that, so we run this idempotent grant pass right
 * after every migrate.
 *
 * Two connection modes:
 *   1. DATABASE_URL set  → connect directly (stg / PR-preview CI, where the
 *      migrate step already has MAPLE_PG_URL). Runtime role defaults to that
 *      URL's username (the managed Hyperdrive is built from the same URL, so
 *      this is a harmless self-grant) unless MAPLE_PG_RUNTIME_ROLE overrides.
 *   2. branch arg only   → broker an ephemeral postgres-inheriting credential
 *      via `withBranchConnection` (prod `main`, applied out of band). The
 *      brokered URL's user is the migration role, NOT the runtime role, so
 *      MAPLE_PG_RUNTIME_ROLE is REQUIRED here.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   # prod (out of band, alongside ps:apply-schema main)
 *   MAPLE_PG_RUNTIME_ROLE=<role> PLANETSCALE_ORG=<org> \
 *     bun packages/db/scripts/grant-runtime-role.ts main
 *
 *   # against a direct connection string (stg / PR preview)
 *   DATABASE_URL="$MAPLE_PG_URL" bun packages/db/scripts/grant-runtime-role.ts

 * identifier charset and reject everything else rather than trust the input.

 * safe because we always double-quote, where Postgres treats it as a literal

 * The grant pass: re-grant the runtime role on every existing table/sequence in

 *
 * We deliberately do NOT use `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`: keyed to the ephemeral
 * migration role it vanishes when that role is dropped each run, and keyed to a
 * hardcoded owner (`postgres`) it breaks wherever the owner role is named
 * differently (local docker, self-grant stg). The explicit re-grant after every
